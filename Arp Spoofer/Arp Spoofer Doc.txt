ARP:  Address Resolution Protocol

Resolves or maps the IP address of a client with the associated MAC address

-- Requesting client/workstation knows the IP address, but not the    MAC address
-- ARP request packet (with IP address of target client) is sent    to all clients/workstations within the network 
-- The client with the associated correct IP address communicates    back with its MAC address 


Scapy ARP:

Pdst =  name of the field which we want to set which is found by scapy.ls(scapy.ARP)
